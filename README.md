# std::vector<bool> Specialization Issues

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `std::vector<bool>` specialization in C++. While it offers memory efficiency, it deviates from the standard `std::vector` behavior, which can lead to unexpected results or crashes when accessing elements, particularly if the vector is empty or if you attempt to access an index beyond the bounds of the vector.

The `bug.cpp` file contains code that illustrates this issue. The `bugSolution.cpp` provides a safer alternative using a standard `std::vector<bool>` or `std::vector<int>`, mitigating the potential for these issues.

**Recommendation:**  Consider avoiding `std::vector<bool>` whenever possible due to its non-standard behavior. Opt for `std::vector<bool>` only when memory efficiency is critical and you completely understand its implications.  If it's not a critical need for the project, a `std::vector<int>` or other vector types that do not cause these issues is always a better choice.
